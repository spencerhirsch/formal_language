    \-\hspace{0.5cm} A Deterministic Finite Accepter is a machine that can process an input
    string from left to right. A Finite Accepter is deterministic when there is only one thing
    that it can do for an input symbol. The DFA will either accept or reject the string. Once
    a String is accepted once, it will always be accepted. 

    \-\hspace{0.5cm} A DFA can only read left to right, just as traditional in the English
    language. The DFA can only see one specific element of a string at a time, it cannot go 
    backwards, nor skip ahead. A DFA also has a specific number of internal states, each
    different based on its current situation, such as when beginning a string. 

    \-\hspace{0.5cm} The example from the book is a great example of a Deterministic Finite Accepter,
    
    \[M = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)\]

    where

    \smallskip

    \-\hspace{0.5cm} \textit{Q} is a finite set of \textbf{internal states}, \\
    \-\hspace{0.5cm} $\Sigma$ is a finite set of symbols called the \textbf{input alphabet}, \\
    \-\hspace{0.5cm} $\delta$: \textit{Q} $\times$ $\Sigma$ $\rightarrow$ \textit{Q} is a total function called the 
    \textbf{transition function}, \\
    \-\hspace{0.5cm} \textit{$q_0$ $\in$ Q} is the \textbf{initial state}, \\
    \-\hspace{0.5cm} \textit{F \ $\subseteq$ Q} is a set of \textbf{final states}.
